When walking around the campus of HM, there were 3 main categories of problems that I organized my observations in. The first category were problems when walking/relaxing around the campus and in the hallways. One of the most common things that popped up was the reoccurence of uncomfortable seats. For instance, there was no padding on the benches in Tillinghast all. In addition, next to the robotics lab, there were spinning chairs with minimal back support - potentially hamrful to the backs of people if sat it for extensive periods of time. With ongoing covid concerns, tents around the field were built this year which serve the purposes of holding classes, or allowing students/teachers to eat there. In those tents are a variety of seats; Some have a table connected to the chair, and some don't. Those that don't have a table prevents some students from sitting on that particular seat as there is no object to conveniently place their food down. There are also several risks inside the building.
