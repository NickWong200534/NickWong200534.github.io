title: Design Manifesto
subtitle: by Nicolas Wong
---

Throughout the school year, my group and I actively searched for a problem in the Horace Mann community that we could fix with an app, in hopes of providing as much value as possible to users. Through this journey, we experienced the design process.  We started by carefully observing the campus for problems that needed to be fixed, and then transitioned to designing the app, performing usability tests on various users, and finally creating a digital version of the app using the software Balsamiq. Together, we called our app HM Comms, which aimed to facilitate communication in our school community. We thought that this was especially necessary during a pandemic, where the majority of communication is being done through First Class, our school email app. Our two primary tasks that we aimed to solve were helping students find club rooms and allowing students to send out polls. Through the creation of HM Comms, I learned an abundance of critical lessons when it comes to creating an effective app regarding the design process, my personal code of ethics, and the app’s accessibility to various users.  

### **Stop Making Apps With No Purpose**

A crucial part of the design process is actually choosing what app you want to make. The best apps are those that provide as much value to their users as possible. This can include games, which provide entertainment, planners, which improve organization skills, etc. However, it is vital that the app greatly impacts others. In the creation of HM Comms, my group first started by walking our school campus, observing the environment and people, seeing what needed to be changed. We eventually identified the overload of emails our school community was getting - and communication in general - as a major problem. Therefore, we sought to aid this problem with our app. If we were to skip this process and invest our time in creating an app that was of little demand and use, no one would benefit from it.

_At the very beginning of the design process, when I was looking for an idea for an app, I jotted down notes while walking around my school campus, looking for anything that needed improvement. This was called the "Fly On The Wall Lab."_

### **Get Opinions From Others**

It is vital to collect the opinions of others because sometimes what you or your group think is not what is best for the app. One of the main sources of advice for me was from my group members. Especially during the initial design process, when we were brainstorming ideas for how exactly we were going to design the app, my group members aided me in determining what was good for the app, and what seemed confusing. Collectively, after a lot of contemplating and brainstorming, my group completed our first paper prototype and we all agreed that that was the best possible version of our app. We then turned to people from outside our group to see if they agreed with our ideas, and sought to find out if they thought that the app was both impactful and easy to navigate through. In order to efficiently gather the opinions of others, we performed usability tests, which allowed people to test our app with our paper prototype. With their advice and constructive criticism, we were able to make our app even better than we thought it was by editing out some aspects of the app, and adding in some crucial features that were essential for the fluidity of the app. Overall, whether it was me listening to opinions from my group members or our group collecting opinions from others using usability tests, gathering opinions from others was essential because I or our idea/ideas may not have actually been the best for the app, so the advice of others allowed me/us to make the necessary edits and make the app the best that it could be.

### **Get Opinions From Others**

As my group and I performed many usability tests throughout the year and collected many opinions on our app, I noticed that a critical aspect regarding my personal code of ethics  in making the iterative design process effective is being open-minded. At the beginning of the design process, I tended to think that the ideas that I brainstormed and put into action had to be correct. If I thought that the design was straightforward and easy to navigate through, others had to think the same. As a result, when receiving constructive criticism from my group and various people that we performed usability tests on, I tended to slightly disregard these comments. However, as we performed more usability tests, the same comments started to arise again and again. Finally, we decided to fix these issues and users started to be able to navigate through the app more comfortably. Even for me, personally, I thought that the app was improving drastically when we enacted the changes that we were recommended by users. Overall, I realized that what I may have thought was best for the app was not. As the year went on and as I quickly opened my mind to criticism, the faster the progress of quality on the app was.

### **Always Aim To Make Your Design As Accessible As Possible**

Another crucial facet of making an app as effective as possible is constantly being cautious of the possible disabilities of others, and making sure our app is accessible to as many people as possible. After all, our main intention for creating this app was to positively impact as many users as possible. Part of reaching this goal is being mindful about people with possible disabilities, and making our app easy to use for them as well. Some of the things that we took into account were the size of our buttons (for people with possible vision impairments) and including directions (for people with possible mental disabilities). With the keeping the disabilities of others in mind at all times, it not only made it more accessible but it also prevented our group from over-complicating the app.

_This is the screen that the user is presented with when they submit an answer to a poll on our app. Although this is a very subtly detail, we tried to make the buttons in our app as big as possible to accomodate for all users._

### **Make Your App As Simple As Possible**

This is a perfect transition into a third necessity in making a successful app, which is making the app as simple as possible. As an app designer, you generally want to cater to the needs and desires of a user, rather than what you, personally, think is best for the app. Ultimately, all users will want an app that is easy to navigate through, as opposed to an app that they will have to invest a lot of time in to figure out how it works. Just think about your previous experiences with complicated apps, or if you’re not too familiar with this experience, just try to imagine it: You download an app, hoping that it provides you with some value in your life. Let's say it’s a homework planner app that you have seen in the App Store, and at first sight, you think that it can possibly improve your organization skills. However, when you download it and you click on the app, you are immediately presented with a variety of complicated buttons and pictures. If that doesn’t immediately make you want to exit the app, maybe you’ll invest ten or fifteen more minutes of your time. Still, you have no idea what to do or where to go. By then, the majority of people will probably click off of the app and hit delete, never wanting to see that app again. This is exactly the opposite of what you want in an app. Ideally, you would like to make the life of the user easier by making your app easy to navigate through. This will almost certainly increase the value that the app provides to the user and reduce the amount of stress they go through while using your app.

_Here is a picture of our home page (split into two) of our digital prototype that we made on Balsamiq. As you can see, we tried to make everything as simple as possible: There are very clearly a list of clubs that the user can click on in the middle of the screen, options to send out a poll and view club rooms on the bottom left and right of the screen respectively. Overall, everything is pretty simple to navigate throguh_

These five core concepts are what guided my team and I to create a complete, cohesive, and (what I would deem) successful app. Starting out as a completely clueless individual with no prior experience, I experienced what did and did not work during the design process.
