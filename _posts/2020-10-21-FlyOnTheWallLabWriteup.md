title: Fly On The Wall Observation Writeup
subtitle: by Nicolas Wong
---

Throughout this fly on the wall lab, the main purpose was to wander around Horace Mann, looking out for any potential problems, or observations in general.  One of the things I noticed was the recurrence of uncomfortable seats. For instance, there was no padding on the benches in Tillinghast Hall. In addition, next to the robotics lab, there were spinning chairs with minimal back support - potentially harmful to the backs of people if sat on for extensive periods of time. With ongoing covid concerns, tents around the field were built this year which serve the purposes of holding classes, or allowing students/teachers to eat there. In those tents are a variety of seats; Some have a table connected to the chair, and some don't. Those that don't have a table constraints some students from sitting on that particular seat as there is no object to conveniently place their food down on. There are also several risks/inconveniences inside the building. Especially with how there is a 5 minute gap in between classes to allow students to go from place to place, the hallways often get relatively crowded. A major concern that I observed was how wide the staircase is, and how there are no railings in the middle of it. Also, near the dance studio and vending machines, there are benches on a ramp, which makes it very uncomfortable to sit on because the incline sways you off the bench. In the library, I also noticed that the keyboard and mouses are used by everyone daily. Everytime I go on to use it, I feel a sense of disgust with the paranoia/thought of there being germs on it. Also, in the dance studio where the students had classes in, bags were scattered around the floor and it seemed pretty messy. Especially during a time of pandemic, this practice of recklessly placing personal belongings on the floor should be stopped. Furthermore, I noticed  that in the library, one of the hand sanitizer dispensers had the texture of lotion rather than being a liquid that could dry off in a matter of seconds. As well, through personal experience and observation, I recognized that it was extremely difficult for students to communicate and clearly hear each other through the barriers. To add on, not only were these barriers a hindrance to communication, but also a major obstacle when trying to see the board. For instance, if a student was sitting anywhere other than the first row, the barriers would obscure the vision for those students, sometimes causing them to stand up and move closer to the board. Nevertheless, it is a major inconvenience. Additionally, when walking through the hallways of Tillinghast, I noticed how thin the lockers were, having the length of a history textbook. Through our 2 weeks of remote learning, I also collected some data on the software, “Zoom,” which we had our classes on. One of the most recurring problems was regarding audio when students/teachers were sometimes incomprehensible. Also, when intending to participate in class, students would often be ignored by teachers, presumably because the teacher did not recognize them. 

With the data collected during remote learning and in-person school, I separated them in three main groups. First, there were problems when walking/relaxing on campus. Observations that fell into this group included some inconvenient seats and the constraints that came with them, table-less seats in the tents, and the placement of a bench on a slope. This makes me realize how potentially helpful something that informs students where specific seats are going to be will be. This can specifically tailor to some who have back problems, and would specifically prefer some seats more than others. Another group that I separated my data in regarded observations covid concerns.  Observations in this category included students placing their book bags all over the floor, and reused keyboard and mouses. Through these observations, I formed a theory :Kids tend to be less attentive and more careless when it comes to the coronavirus compared to adults. Students sometimes take their masks off for as long as possible, and without care, place all of their belongings on the floor. This makes me curious if some kinds of reward/disciplinary system can be formed if students are not completely following all covid protocols. The last group of data was inconveniences in the classroom during in-person school and remote learning. Data that fell into this category included barriers hindering vision of the board and the voice of students, lockers not being big enough, teachers not being able to see the hands of students on zoom, and some occasions of poor audio on zoom. I realized that especially with the barriers and audio problems, most of these dilemmas have to do with communication. This makes me curious as to if there is any better way to communicate to others as an app or other technological device may be necessary. 

I first started this data collection process during the last week of remote learning. During some of my zoom classes, I jotted down some recurring observations. Additionally, in our mobile apps class, we discussed a variety of articles we had previously read, which is when I had gathered the majority of my data. We returned to school the week after and we were given about 20 minutes to roam around campus and note any observations.
