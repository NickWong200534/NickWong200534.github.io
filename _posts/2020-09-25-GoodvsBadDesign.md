Here, I will be talking about good and bad designs of a chair, comparing them, and explaining why they are either good or bad.

The chair above is a poorly designed one. Firstly, the material of the chair, which is metal, makes it severely uncomfortable to sit in for extended periods of time. Additionally, there is no pivoting mechanism on the chair, disabling the user from being able to turn and twist at leisure. The back support of the chair is also fixed. This prevents the user from being able to lean back and relax.

This chair, on the other hand, is a very well-designed chair. For reasons contrary to why the first chair was poorly designed, this chair offers superb back support. The chair is reclinable, allowing the user to comfortably lean back. Additionally, this chair is made out of metal, allowing the user to be able to sit on this chair for longer periods of time.
